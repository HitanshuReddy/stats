# stats
This is a collection of my mini-projects that use various statistical techniques/methods.

The .pdf file is the summary of the techniques performed on different datasets.

The source_code is a .ipynb file where you can see the raw code.

chicago_taxi.xlsx is the dataset used to prove a research question using bayes theorem.

ptechdata.xlsx is the dataset on which factor analysis was performed.

I wrote down some key findings and final remarks from the project.

- In this Project we have discussed about the data that we have used in real data analysis. Then, we discussed different statistical techniques and terms to inform more about our simulated data and real data.

- In Factor Analysis we first used Parallel analysis to findout possible number of Factors the data can be reduced to and the we use fa() i.e factor analysis to sucessfully reduce dimension of a Nine feature dataset to just three features by setting aside 50% of the variance.

- Additionally, Markov Chains and it's different properties were discussed like Ergodicity. Recurrent Events, Variance Reduction Techniques like Simulation, Antithetic Variates, Control Variates Importance sampling were visualized. Simulation of Combinatorial Analysis was also performed. (**This concepts are the building blocks of Deep Reinforcement Learning like Markov Decision Processes**)

- Bayes's theorem was used to find out some questions on real world data. We found out answers for our research questions of whether Taxi drivers get tipped more on a weekend. with this specific dataset we found out that there is less than half likelihood of passengers in Chicago tipping more on a weekend i.e 46%.

- Covered Simulation of Different Distributions Continuous and Discrete. Verified Central Limit Theorem for Normal Distribution, Exponential Distribution, Poisson Distribution and Binomial Distribution.Statistical measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quantiles were given for the simulated data using code.
